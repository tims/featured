Featured Server
===============

Loads a directory full of "feature" files and lets you select items by feature values. You can filter and order items by those features. Features are named by the filename. This is a quick way to load data sets in memory and do selection and sorting of items on demand. Handy glue for exploring prepared data files.

The interface is a thrift server.

Dependencies
------------

Requires boost and thrift, compile with scons.

Feature Files
-------------

A feature file is a tab seperated file of item id to feature values. They need not be sorted, but each id should be unique.

eg::

  1  37
  2  492
  3  18
  4  5
  5  314

Feature values may be integer or decimial numbers.
